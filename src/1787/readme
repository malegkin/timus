Difficulty: 28

A traffic light at the turn for the “MEGA” shopping center from the Novomoskovskiy 
highway works in such a way that k cars are able to take a turn in one minute. 
At weekends all the residents of the city drive to the mall to take a shopping, 
which results in a huge traffic jam at the turn. Administration of the mall ordered 
to install a camera at the nearby bridge, which is able to calculate the number 
of cars approaching this turn from the city. The observation started n minutes 
ago. You should use the data from the camera to determine the number of cars 
currently standing in the traffic jam.

Input
The first line contains integers k and n (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 100), which are the number 
of cars that can take a turn to “MEGA” in one minute and the number of minutes 
passed from the beginning of observation. The second line contains space-separated 
integers a1, …, an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the number of cars that approached 
the turn during the i-th minute. The observation started at morning, when there 
were no cars at the turn.
