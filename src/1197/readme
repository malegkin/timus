Time limit: 1.0 second
Memory limit: 64 MB
Difficulty: 30


The statement of this problem is very simple: you are to determine how many 
squares of the chessboard can be attacked by a knight standing alone on the board. 
Recall that a knight moves two squares forward (horizontally or vertically in any 
direction) and then one square sideways (perpedicularly to the first direction).

Input
The first line contains the number N of test cases, 1 ≤ N ≤ 100. Each of the 
following N lines contains a test: two characters. The first character is a 
lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'h' and the second character is an integer 
from 1 to 8; they specify the rank and file of the square at which the knight is 
standing.

Output
Output N lines. Each line should contain the number of the squares of the chessboard that are under attack by the knight.
