Today is one of the best days, she's going shopping to the new skyscraper “Prisma”. At first she decided to visit all the stores. But actually the “Prisma” is so large that you can find not just one store of each brand. Every time when Cindy found the brand, she has visited before, she told “Bayan”, and went on shopping.
